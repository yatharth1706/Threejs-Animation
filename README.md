### ThreeJs

#### What is ThreeJS?

	Its a lighweight JavaScript Library for making cool 3d Animation Designs which internally is built on WebGL

### Documentation

	Documentation is available here [documentation](https://threejs.org/)

#### Components Required In Code

	1. Scene :- Its like a virtual world where you will create animation objects
	2. Camera :- Its like a virtual camera which will be able to see virtual scene that we will create
	3. Renderer :- Nothing is yet visible to user. With the help of renderer we can show what virtual camera is able to see

### Some extra concepts

#### For Using Shapes:

	Three things are required:
	1. Geometry: Type of shape
	2. Material: Texture or color that you want to add to geometry
	3. Mesh: Combine material with geometry

#### Mesh

	Mesh is a collection of vertices, edges and faces that defines a shape of any polyhedral (3d shape width polygonal shapes) object. The faces of object can contain any shape be it triangle, or any polygon and it simplifies rendering.
